## 6.1 Demo Mode & Sample Files

The application ships with a professional demo mode for instant showcases without waiting for full model runs:

- Demo files are automatically downloaded at startup (if missing) into `demo_audio/` and preprocessed into `demo_results/` for blazing-fast responses.
- Available demos:
  - [Yuri_Kizaki.mp3](https://www.mitsue.co.jp/service/audio_and_video/audio_production/media/narrators_sample/yuri_kizaki/03.mp3) — Japanese narration about website communication
  - [Film_Podcast.mp3](https://www.lightbulblanguages.co.uk/resources/audio/film-podcast.mp3) — French podcast discussing films like The Social Network
- Static serving: demo audio is exposed at `/demo_audio/<filename>` for local preview.
- The UI provides two selectable cards under Demo Mode; once selected, the system loads a preview and renders a waveform using HTML5 Canvas (Web Audio API) before processing.

These cached demo results ensure instant transcript, translation, and analytics display when you click "Process Audio" in Demo Mode.
