## 7.1 Demo Mode & Sample Files

The application includes a demo mode for testing without waiting for full model processing:

- Demo files are automatically downloaded at startup (if missing) into `demo_audio/` and preprocessed into `demo_results/` for quick responses.
- Available demos:
  - [Yuri_Kizaki.mp3](https://www.mitsue.co.jp/service/audio_and_video/audio_production/media/narrators_sample/yuri_kizaki/03.mp3) — Japanese narration about website communication
  - [Film_Podcast.mp3](https://www.lightbulblanguages.co.uk/resources/audio/film-podcast.mp3) — French podcast discussing films like The Social Network
  - [Tamil_Wikipedia_Interview.ogg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tamil_Wikipedia_Interview.ogg) — Tamil language interview (36+ minutes)
  - [Car_Trouble.mp3](https://www.tuttlepublishing.com/content/docs/9780804844383/06-18%20Part2%20Car%20Trouble.mp3) — Conversation about waiting for a mechanic and basic assistance (2:45)
- Static serving: demo audio is exposed at `/demo_audio/<filename>` for local preview.
- The UI provides enhanced selectable cards under Demo Mode; once selected, the system loads a preview and renders a waveform using HTML5 Canvas (Web Audio API) before processing.

These cached demo results provide quick access to transcript, translation, and analytics when using Demo Mode.

## 8. Core Components

- **Audio Intelligence Pipeline:**
  The `main.py` module implements a comprehensive audio processing pipeline that orchestrates speaker diarization, speech recognition, neural translation, and advanced enhancements. It features advanced preprocessing with noise reduction, model selection, progress tracking, and multi-format output generation with error handling and performance monitoring.

- **Advanced Speaker Diarization:**
  The `speaker_diarizer.py` module uses pyannote.audio 3.1 for speaker identification with clustering algorithms, voice activity detection, and speaker embedding extraction. The `speaker_verifier.py` module extends this with advanced speaker verification using SpeechBrain, Wav2Vec2, and enhanced feature extraction for robust speaker identification and verification.

- **Multilingual Speech Recognition:**
  The `speech_recognizer.py` module integrates faster-whisper for automatic speech recognition supporting 99+ languages with language identification, word-level timestamps, and confidence scoring. Features include VAD-based processing, batch optimization, and INT8 quantization.

- **Multi-Tier Neural Machine Translation:**
  The `translator.py` module provides translation capabilities using a 3-tier system:
  - **Tier 1**: Helsinki-NLP Opus-MT models for supported language pairs
  - **Tier 2**: Google Translate API alternatives (googletrans, deep-translator) for broad coverage
  - **Tier 3**: mBART50 multilingual model for offline fallback and code-switching support
  - Features dynamic model loading, caching strategies, and quality assessment through confidence scoring.

- **Web Interface:**
  The `templates/index.html` implements a responsive interface featuring dual processing modes (demo/full), real-time progress tracking, interactive visualizations, and result presentation with multiple export options.

- **Advanced Noise Reduction:**
  The `noise_reduction.py` module provides advanced speech enhancement using machine learning models (SpeechBrain Sepformer, Demucs) and sophisticated signal processing techniques including adaptive spectral subtraction, Kalman filtering, non-local means denoising, and wavelet denoising for SNR -5 to 20 dB operation.

- **Model Preloading System:**
  The `model_preloader.py` module provides model downloading and caching with progress visualization, dependency verification, system optimization, and error handling for deployment.
